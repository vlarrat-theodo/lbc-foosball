# Foosball rules
- A set ends when one user has 10 points. At that moment, the user scores one set, and a new set starts, with both players at 0.
- If a gamelle is scored, the scorer doesn't get points but the opponents loses one.
- As a consequence, points can be negative.
- If the player9 scores, "pissette": no points are counted, even if it's a gamelle. These goals have absolutely no impact on the score.
- If any midfielder scores, it's a "demi": no points are scored, but two points are stored “in
balance”. They will be scored by the next player to score a real goal. Note that scoring a
gamelle doesn’t allow to score the points in balance. There’s a tricky case: if a gamelle is
scored from the demis, nothing happens.
